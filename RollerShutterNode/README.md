# RollerShutterNode


It is a board for controlling rollershutter (0-100%) and detecting end stops.. It have two relays (UP and DOWN) and ACS712 for current sense of motor. You can connect two push buttons. This board can be used as dual relay board too, with current sense.


Note : it is still in dev.



- Arduino Pro Mini footprint
