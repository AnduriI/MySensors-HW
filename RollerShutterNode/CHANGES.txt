November 15 2015 (Scalz):
    First version of RollerShutterNode. Derived in two version : NRF24 smd and RFM69(H)W
	
    Features:
		It is a board for controlling rollershutter (0-100%) and detecting end stops with ACS712 for current sense of motor. It can be used as a relay board too.
		You can connect 3 push buttons (UP/DOWN/STOP) and/or external i2c device (for tactile, gesture...). 
		It can control 12-220V motors.      
   
    Known issues: in debug phase
		- there was an error on v1.0. I did so much changes in routing that I missed to change something on acs. So the spst relay is always on. too bad.
		  This is fixed in v1.1
