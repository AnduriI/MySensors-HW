# Mysensors HW
My personal Workspace for MySensors Hardware

- OneRelaisMySensors : still in dev (waiting for pcb) A simple, basic, board to control one relais for Mysensors.


- DCBoosterWithSupervisor : still in dev (waiting for pcb) It is a small board with only DCBooster3V and 2V Supervisor. It could be used to add functionality in nodes. Based on ulpnode idea.

- PowerManagementMySensorNode : still in dev (waiting for pcb). I mixed Anticimex(Patrick Fallberg) SensorsNode with functionalities of ulpnode. All credits to them for concepts and idea. Here is my version.
